ChangeLog:
	* 0.0  initial release
	* 0.1  addition of ATUSB_TEST
	* 0.2  First public release. Compatible with atusb driver in the upcoming 4.2 kernel
	* 0.3	* ATUSB_EUI64_READ/WRITE for permanent EUI64 handling
		* Support to run the firmware on Atmel Raven USB dongles (Alexander Aring)
		* Remove FCS frame check from firmware and leave it to the driver
		* Use extended operation mode for TX for automatic ACK handling

To flash the firmware you need dfu-util on the host. Issue

    dfu-util -d 20b7:1540 -D atusb-0.3.dfu

right after plugging the device into the USB port while the red led is still
on.

For the Atmel Raven USB dongle a full JTAG setup is needed to flash the
firmware as no DFU bootloader is available there.

The firmware is flashed into permanent storage and does not need to be provided
after power off. A new firmware version can be flashed the same way.

Firmware source code is GPLv2+ and can be found here:
